As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate binary files such as videos, images, or audio files. The file "app_studio/static/img/explainer_videos.mp4" is a video file, and it should be created or provided by a video producer or a graphic designer. Once the video is ready, it can be placed in the specified directory.
